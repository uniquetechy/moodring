	Moodring is a small, uncomplicated script that responds to a user's mood with an inspirational quote.  
	It is designed to make the individual feel better regardless of their response.  If a response is 
	given that it doesn't recognize, it prompts the user to try again.  It is basically a digital mood ring, 
	and is infinitely expandable.

	Simply copy the moodring directory to your home folder and go to the moodring directory, then type 
	moodring.sh to run the script (you may need to make the moodring.sh file executable the first time; 
	type chmod +x moodring.sh).

	Moodring also includes a script that prints the numbers 1-50 to the terminal.
